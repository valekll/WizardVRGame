 A Wizard Dueling Game for VR!
This is a game I designed by myself using C# and Unity for my Occulus Quest. Every asset in 
the game is made by myself in blender or sourced royalty free. The game is a multiplayer game 
where you are a wizard who can shoot fireballs, levitate objects, and teleport around the world. 
You are free to interact in real time with anyone in game including shooting them with fireballs 
and blocking with intercepting blocks.

A demo video of the game can be found in the Demo directory.
